# Devv - The First AI Coding Agent to Build Full-Stack AI Products

## Project Overview
Devv is an innovative web application designed to empower users to create full-stack AI-powered products quickly and efficiently. With a user-friendly interface and native integrations for essential services, Devv aims to help indie builders and small teams turn their ideas into reality. The application features an intuitive input area where users can describe their projects and receive optimized solutions and code generation based on their specifications.

## Installation
To run Devv locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devv.git
   cd devv
   ```

2. **Open `index.html`**:
   Just open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser to view the application. There are no additional dependencies required for this static setup.

## Usage
Once you have the application open in your browser:
- Use the text area to describe what you want to build.
- Click the buttons available in the toolbar to:
  - Select different options for public settings.
  - Integrate necessary components.
  - Send the request by pressing `Ctrl` + `Enter`.
- Explore example project ideas that can be generated to inspire your development.

## Features
- **Dynamic Input Areas**: Allows users to input descriptions of desired products easily.
- **Integration Support**: Options available for integrating various features directly.
- **Example Suggestions**: Predefined examples to help users get started quickly.
- **Responsive Design**: Built to work seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.

## Dependencies
The project is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and does not have external dependencies listed in a `package.json` because it is a static web application.

## Project Structure
The project repository contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML document which includes the structure and content of the application.
- `styles.css`: The stylesheet for the project. While it is currently empty, it can be used to style the HTML elements to improve the user interface.
- `script.js`: This JavaScript file is referenced for adding interactive features to the application.

## Acknowledgements
This project is inspired by the growing need for AI-driven tools that simplify the development process and streamline the creation of full-stack applications.
